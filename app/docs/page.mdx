EternisUI provides a set of reusable animated components crafted with Motion and Tailwind CSS. Effortlessly enhance your web projects with smooth, captivating animations, adding interactivity and enjoyment to the user experience.
## Vision

As a developer, I often faced challenges finding practical, high-quality animated components designed for real-world applications. EternisUI was born to bridge this gap, offering ready-to-use, customizable components to elevate marketing websites and web applications.
### Easy to Use and customize

Each component comes with thorough examples and detailed documentation, allowing you to use them as-is or effortlessly customize them to fit your unique UI kit, design system, or specific needs.

### Designed with Motion at its core

All components are built on [Motion](https://motion.dev/), providing a robust foundation and highlighting the library's potential. Future updates will include versions utilizing only CSS and Tailwind CSS.
### Open source and community-driven

EternisUI is open-source. Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the collection.
